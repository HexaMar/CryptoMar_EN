## üöÄ Features

* Lightning-fast Bitcoin address generation using a native C++ library.
* Support for Bech32 (P2WPKH) Bitcoin addresses.
* Multi-threaded generation and verification with minimal memory usage.
* An up-to-date database of all existing P2WPKH addresses with balances, current as of early May 2025.


## üîì How It Works

### üóùÔ∏è Private and Public Key Generation

* The program randomly generates a 256-bit number, which becomes the private key.
* A public key is created from the private key using elliptic curve cryptography (secp256k1).
* The public key is hashed twice (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160) to create a Public Key Hash, which is then used to generate the Bech32 (P2WPKH) address.

### üöÄ How Wallet Brute-Forcing Works

* The program generates millions of private keys and corresponding Bech32 addresses.
* Each address is checked for a balance in a database of known addresses with confirmed balances.
* If an address with a balance is found, the private key is saved and the user is notified.


## üåê How Many Wallets with Balances?

As of early May 2025, the program's database contains **18226528** Bech32 (P2WPKH) addresses** with confirmed balances > 0.00001 BTC.


## ‚ùì Why Is the Author Sharing This Program?

Brute-forcing private keys is a matter of substantial time and computational power. The author created this software to distribute the process among a large number of people. The user who finds the correct key receives 90% of the funds, while the author receives 10%.
